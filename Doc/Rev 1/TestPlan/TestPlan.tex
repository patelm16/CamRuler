\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of CamRuler is to simplify the process of measuring an object by allowing the user to use their phone’s camera to measure any object. Having this app on mobile devices will enable users to conveniently measure objects without the struggle of ﬁnding a ruler and doing tedious measurements by hand.

\noindent The purpose for testing this project is to ensure that the application works properly and that the functionality of this project can be achieved. Having adequate test cases for this project will increase the quality of user experience and lead to a satisfactory use of the application.

\subsection{Scope}
This document provides a meaningful method to ensure that CamRuler meets all the technical, functional and non-functional requirements. This test plan will describe the strategy for testing each of the requirements as well as describe the testing framework that will be used for all testing related to this application.

		\hline 
		Calculation function & This function allows the user to input the reference object's length in cm, m, or mm, and the application calculates the actual object's length using a ratios algorithm.\\

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Test Team}
The testing team comprises of the following developers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prince Kowser
    \item Meet Patel
    \item Kshitij Mehta
\end{itemize}

This group of individuals will be responsible for writing and executing all tests.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

This project will undergo automated testing through {\color{red}JUnit}. Methods which can have an input value such as the mathematical ratios used to calculate measurements of objects can be tested through an automated means. Stubs of edge cases, normal cases, and negative cases will be created in order to be run and ensure that the program methods run properly. Stubs will also be created to test error handling in case the user enters something wrong. We also plan on having an efficient time taken to do the calculations so we will also run time tests to make sure that the calculations are being conducted within a reasonable amount of time. Because we do not have all our implementation done, we have just planned these aforementioned tests. Upon completion of the implementation, we will think of and conduct more tests that could be tested automatically. Automated tests tend to have an input and output value which could be compared to other values. Tests such as checking if a picture is set as the background of the application would have to be done manually.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
This application will use {\color{red}JUnit} as it's main unit testing framework. {\color{red}Stubs will be generated for the calculation module and  results will be compared to our coverage metrics. Our metrics include that we receive a 95\%+ accuracy rate to the original measurements of objects through manual testing and 100\% for calculation testing as they are just simple ratios.If metrics not met, then we will have to figure out a better implementation.With our project being an Android application, a lot of the testing would be done manually and through user feedback. Due to this reason, we would only be using JUnit to test the calculations taking place in our application, whereas the other tests would be done manually.}

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}
The Proof of Concept testing will be used to verify the current implementation. This will be done through manual as the implementation currently finished is all interface based. This testing will also show that the project is feasible. The proof of concept testing will include testing the interface ‘capture’ button as well as setting the image captured to be the background of the application.

\subsection{Capture Picture Button Captures Image}
		
\begin{enumerate}

\item{PC-1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: No input is set
					
Input: Clicking the capture button on the application screen
					
Output: User is enabled to take a picture of object to be measured
					
How test will be performed: This test will be conducted by simply clicking on the capture button on the user interface to make sure that our capture button correctly works. Clicking the button will allow user to take a picture. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Picture Captured As Application Background}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{PC-2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: No input is set, but location of image taken is set
					
Input: A picture which is taken by the user upon clicking capture button
					
Output: Picture taken by user should appear as the background of the application from where user can select options from
					
How test will be performed: This test will be conducted by comparing the output to the existing implementation where once the user takes a picture, it is set as the background image from which the features of the application can be used.  

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Application Does Not Crash on Open}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{PC-3\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: No input is set
					
Input: App is opened on device by user
					
Output: Screen with capture button appears 
					
How test will be performed: This test will be conducted by opening the application on the mobile device and ensuring that it does not crash and the functions to run the application are presented to the user.  

\end{enumerate}

	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

Since the existing implementation was successful in terms of its functionality, we could use it to compare our implementation to in order to see if we are going down the correct path. The following tests compare the program to the existing implementation called CameraRuler:

\begin{itemize}
\item{PC-1\\}
\item{PC-2\\}
\item{FR-PT-1\\}
\item{FR-PT-2\\}
\item{FR-UD-3\\}
\item{FR-C-6\\}
\item{FR-C-9\\}

\end{itemize}
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}

As Java is being used to implement the project, the {\color{red}JUnit} Framework will be used in order to perform unit testing.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

To test internal functions of the application, methods can be tested individually through an automated means. Methods which return values would be simplest to test using {\color{red}JUnit}. Such methods which could be testing for this application would be the ratio calculations and metric conversions. This would require an input value and an expected output value which would then be verified by {\color{red}JUnit} if the formulas are correct. Because unit testing is quick using {\color{red}JUnit}, every method with an input and output can be tested for normal values as well as edge case values. Inputs generating exceptions will also be tested to make sure of correct error handling. Stubs may have to be created to test all possible cases as we do not want program to crash on any kind of input. Coverage metrics will be used in order to maintain that the application works effectively and as we know that 100\% coverage is usually not possible, we will aim for perfection while testing the internal functions as they are very important to our application’s success. 
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}

There are no output files to be tested with this program as the final implementation simply requires a picture taken by the user, and a selection of a few points and metrics.
