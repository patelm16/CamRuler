\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of CamRuler is to simplify the process of measuring an object by allowing the user to use their phone’s camera to measure any object. Having this app on mobile devices will enable users to conveniently measure objects without the struggle of ﬁnding a ruler and doing tedious measurements by hand. Our motivation for this project is to increase the efficiency of measuring an object by providing an accurate and easy-to-use platform. This project can be worthwhile for many clients as it can be used in various industries including construction, architecture, product modelling or even something as trivial as a student lab. Using this application can increase productivity and provide a good business opportunity for our clients.\\   

\noindent The goal of this application is to make it easier for anyone to measure objects. We will be using Java and Android to build this application. We hope to boost productivity and efficiency for our customers, thus making our goal a service goal.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of this product is the group of developers themselves. The developers are interested in re-deploying the app with improvements that make the app more efficient and user friendly .

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of this product are specifically students and the general public for daily use. Students often need precise measurements in labs, or in school for specific courses like construction class. This app can eliminate the use of long ruler sticks and uncertainty with measurements for students. The general public also need daily measurements and often times they don’t have measuring tools at the tip of their hands. The may need to measure a table, their height, or even something large. This app can come very handy for them as it allows them to measure anything they can fit in a picture. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Carpenters
    \item Plumbers
    \item Technicians who need quick and precise measurements
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Description: The product shall operate on mobile phones with an Android operating system.\\ \\
Rationale: The product will be targeting Android users\\ \\
Fit Criterion: The product shall be approved by the testing group of the operating system

\item Description: The product shall use the phone’s camera to take a picture and measure the object\\ \\
Rationale: The client will not use any other devices other than their phone.\\ \\
Fit Criterion: Any applications (eg. camera) required to run the product will already be existing in the phone and there shall be no need to install anything else.

\item Description: The product shall allow the user to select the object they would like to measure.\\ \\
Rationale: The client should be able to pick the object they would like to measure from the picture that they take.\\ \\ 
Fit Criterion: Any selection of objects will be done by allowing the user to draw a line on the screen where the line will be going across the object’s length on the screen.

\item Description: The product shall use a reference object to measure the desired object.\\ \\
Rationale: The product cannot measure an object’s size unless it has another object’s measurements it can use as a reference.\\ \\
Fit Criterion: Reference objects will be selected using the same process where the client will be prompted to input the known or estimated dimensions of that object. The product will use those dimensions to create a ratio, and output the dimensions of the desired object.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
The product will require an Android environment along with the necessary storage space required to install the product on the client’s phone.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Application}
The product will heavily rely on the phone’s camera. A camera is not part of the product however the product will use the camera application installed on the phone to achieve its functionality.

\subsubsection{Off The Shelf}
The product will use Eclipse, Java, and Android Studio in order to implement the requirements of the product. All the OTS software listed above is free and can be installed from the Internet.

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The product should be used in an environment with bright lighting so that users can see the objects taken in a picture. The reference object and desired object should be on the same surface in order to get the best measurements. The product can be used at any workplace,whether they be indoor or outdoor. 

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
The product must be completed by December 2017. There is no constraint on windows of opportunity as this product can be used anywhere at anytime. 

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
A budget is not applicable to this project. Any required resources are free and can be downloaded from the Internet.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The product will be free to install and accessible to any user with an Android mobile device. There are no enterprises who will be making an investment in this project other than the developers themselves.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

A relevant fact about this project is that there are approximately 800 lines of code for the original implementation of CamRuler. An assumption that will be made is that the device on which this application will be installed will also have a camera application. It will also be assumed that the user has the required storage space and memory in order to install the application on their device. Another assumption that will be made is that the developers will have the product completed and ready to be used by the deadline.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
We still need to investigate how to use Android Studio as we have little experience with it. Other open issues will be added after we have begun developing our implementation.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
\begin{itemize}
\item Camera Ruler Beta Version Android Application
    \item{Application works, but is still being further developed before being released to general public on app store}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development not yet started, so reusable components not yet recognized (if available).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can use interface and organization of Camera Ruler Beta Application
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
Adding in the feature to enable users to zoom into pictures for a more precise selection of the reference point may cause some errors which we will need to account for as the code right now does not account for zooming into the picture. If no additional features are added, no effects on the current environment are foreseen.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
Recreating an Android application to work on Android devices should cause no errors. Also, this interface is planned to stand alone and hence, will not impact any other systems.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
Prior to implementation, a potential user problem we think may occur is not being able to click the correct spot and hence, getting a slightly inaccurate measurement. Users will be warned that the measurement is only as accurate as they tap on the correct spot. However, as developers, we plan to try and create a zoom feature which will enable the user to be more accurate in point selection. 

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
Being an already existing application that works in beta form, we know that our application, if done correctly and as planned, should work on Android devices. Only limitation is doing the application on Android Studio may be tough as there is a time constraint of approximately 2.5 months.
\subsection{Tasks}
Tasks for this project have been outlined by the course instructor of Software Engineering 3XA3. Deliverables include the Problem Statement, Proof of Concept plan, Requirements document revision 0, Test plan revision 0, Proof of concept demonstration, Design document revision 0, Revision 0 demonstration, Peer evaluation of other teams revision 0, User’s guide revision 0, Test report revision 0, Final demonstration (Revision 1), and Final documentation (Revision 1).  The final project is due on December 6th, 2017. Our project plan is created on a Gantt chart which is available on gitlab. Use of the waterfall method will be used to get our project successfully completed. However, the main thing is that we need to stay on top of time constraints as that is our only worry.
\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
\subsubsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
We may need to find similar libraries to which Camera Ruler used to stay consistent with requirements which would work with Android Studio as well. However, we are still planning our implementation so this may change and we may not need similar libraries to the parent application.

\subsubsection{Data That Has to Be Modified or Translated for the New System}
No data needs to be translated for the new system, however, to be safe, we will verify the mathematical calculations provided by Camera Ruler to be safe. This verification is planned to take place right before the implementation of the application and will be done by ratio calculations. 
\subsection{Risks}
Risks we found were related to the development of the product. It may be too complex for us as we are still learning Android Studio and making an Android Application. After having this completed, we also need to make sure it works properly where testing may also be complicated as there are multiple aspects to test such as if the picture taken is the background of the app, and if reference points are able to be placed and dragged to the correct spot. All in all, schedule pressure seems to be the only risk at the moment.

\subsection{Costs}
No money is going into the making of this application, but the cost we may have would be related to time as we may not get enough time to implement all that we have planned to implement at the moment. 

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
Instructions on how to use the application will follow in sequence on the application. With our planned interface being very simple, the user will be prompted to take a picture they want to measure along with a reference object in the same picture and then will be asked to pick points to measure in the metric they have selected. Due to this simplicity, we do not plan on creating a separate user manual/help guide, as the instructions will be on screen for the user to follow.

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
As aforementioned, the simplicity of this application is such that no training will be required for the user.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
A new feature which could be added would be dragging the reference points so that more accurate measurements could be made. To do this, more research will be done on dragging and dropping on a live interface. Another idea to have more accurate measurements would be to zoom into a picture so the exact point of measurement could be determined. As of now we only have measurements in straight lines, so a future implementation could be to allow users to measure objects in curved shapes as well. 

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
For zooming into a picture, dragging points, or measuring curved objects we do not have any ideas, so more research and planning will need to be done in order to actually implement these ideas.
